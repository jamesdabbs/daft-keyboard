# daft-keyboard

A crash course on writing a Daft Punk MIDI sampler in Ruby, using a [Novation LaunchPad]() as our MIDI controller.

* `hello.rb` is the file that we wrote during the course
* `example.rb` is a sample with the background-coloring idea fleshed out

Questions 100% welcome; please reach out if you have any!
